## About this project

This is just a side project so I can see the latest changes
on Laravel (using sail and developing my test skill)

The main idea of this project is to register all the products
you bought, with quantity and type (if unit or kg) and 
register how much of each product you consumed, to avoid 
throwing food away.

The idea is to send a warning daily about the products that
are going to expire in the coming days, so you plan your
next meals using those ingredients. I will use the Telegram 
API to send those requests.

Right now, I just started the project, so there is much to do.

### TO-DO

[ ] Integrate Telegram API

[ ] Create CRUD about Consumptions

[ ] Make more tests

[ ] Create cron function to calculate how much was consumed
